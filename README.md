# Data-Structures-Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures Algorithms** repository! This repository contains key Java implementations of algorithms and data structures, focusing on **graphs** and **trees**. Dive into fundamental concepts like graph traversal, shortest path algorithms, and balanced tree operations.

## Features

### Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  - Traverses vertices layer by layer starting from a source vertex.  
  - Ideal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch, then backtracks.  
  - Useful for connectivity exploration and cycle detection.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**  
  - Finds the shortest paths in weighted graphs.  
  - Utilizes a priority queue for efficiency.

### Tree Algorithm
- **Red-Black Tree**  
  - A self-balancing binary search tree ensuring O(log n) complexity.  
  - Supports efficient insertions, deletions, and lookups.
